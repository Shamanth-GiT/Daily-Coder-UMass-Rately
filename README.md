# *UMass Recreation Center Participatory Crowd Sensing* by Daily Coder

## Application Idea
**Problem:**
Google reviews indicate that many UMass Amherst Recreation Center users are frustrated with overcrowding and waiting long periods of time to use various popular gym machines. In fact, I myself face this issue on a daily basis during the college year; I find myself wasting precious time waiting to use equipment or trying to find empty spots to workout in.

**Solution Idea:**
While I know Google already has the the `Popular Times` feature, it is not very accurate as it is a generalized tool. My app will be more localized and specific to community participation and hence - I am hoping - be more fine tuned and relevant to the actual crowd levels. A wepapp such as this one will allow many students to build a reliable gym discipline that fits into their busy daily schedules.

## Functionality
I am hoping to establish a one-page web application that is initialized to show a poll that requests for crowd info based on gym regions (Floor 1, Floor 2, Floor 3):
- very busy 
- moderately busy
- not busy
- view status

Upon completion a status section appears on the page that provides users with the live crowd info, based on the statistics users can then make decision as to waiting until later or to go upon view.
The data used to measure crowd level will include:
- count of poll responses
- frequency of each poll option
- Area of gym
- Time of day

## App Usage
