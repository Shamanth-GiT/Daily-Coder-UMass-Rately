## Pop Up
As soon as the page loads the user is met with a pop up that asks for information regarding their current location.

If they are in the gym, they are then met with an inquiry about the location within the gym (Floor 1, 2, 3).

Next, they are asked to rate the crowd level on a scale of 10. Once again, all this is participatory and so the user can exit the pop up dialogue at any point.

## Navigation Bar
The title of the page and the author (Daily Coder) is presented on the left.

On the right there are buttons that will animate the webpage to scroll to the correct locations.

The "Stats" dropdown is yet to be completed.

## Enter Current Status
Users can also update the information that they had previously completed in the pop-up to provide visitors with live updates. 

These will also change the statistics.

## Uploading an Image
Given that this is a bit too impratical to choose a file-image to upload when almost all users in the gym will have phones, I will further try to seek better ways to organize crowd images.

However, in summary, it is simply a way for users to view/upload images in the gym.

## Refresh
When the "Stats" is completed, the user might want to check for live updates as information come in. Hence, the *refresh* button.
