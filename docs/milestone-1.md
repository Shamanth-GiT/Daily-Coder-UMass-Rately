## Application Idea
**Problem:**
Google reviews indicate that many UMass Amherst Recreation Center users are frustrated with overcrowding and waiting long periods of time to use various popular gym machines. In fact, I myself face this issue on a daily basis during the college year; I find myself wasting precious time waiting to use equipment or trying to find empty spots to workout in.

**Solution Idea:**
While I know Google already has the the `Popular Times` feature, it is not very accurate as it is a generalized tool. My app will be more localized and specific to community participation and hence - I am hoping - be more fine tuned and relevant to the actual crowd levels. A wepapp such as this one will allow many students to build a reliable gym discipline that fits into their busy daily schedules.
